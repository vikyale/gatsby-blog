## 4 Great initiatives to find open source projects

Hello, recently I wanted search more projects to practice python and javascript, so here share you some resources to find great projects to collaborate and improve our tech skills :) :

[CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com)
You can take one issue from your favorite repo per day to help you understand and learn more, and stay involved with the code you rely on.

[issuehub.io](http://issuehub.io)
You can search issue labels to find the right project you want to help.

[Pull Request Roulette](http://www.pullrequestroulette.com)
Find open source pull requests that need a reviewer before merging.

[Contrib](https://gauger.io/contrib)
Browse open source projects with issues for beginners.

Good luck :)
